Locations File
==============

The locations file contains the observation locations for predicting synthetic MT data (forward modeling). Because the program **MT3Dfwd.exe** can only forward model data at one frequency at a time, this file only contains the observation locations. 

.. note::
    - Bolded entries are fixed flags recognized by the Fortran codes and blue hyperlinked entries are values/regular expressions specified by the user
